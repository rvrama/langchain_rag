# langchain_rag
First and simple GenAI application to read the pdf data, index it and use it to generate answers using RAG

1. Core_init.py and ChatUI.py is meant to run a simple chatbot (instructional) with RAG (knowledgebase from uploaded pdf). This uses streamlit to build a simple chat UI. (langchain_ex_using_langgraph.py is a old file doing the same as Core_init without stremlit)
2. chatopenai.py - Created a prompt in langsmith hub and used it with conversational chatbot.
